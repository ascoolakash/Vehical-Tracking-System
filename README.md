# Vehical-Tracking-System
This Project presents an automotive localization system using GPS and GSM- SMS services. The system permits localization of the 
automobile and transmitting the position to the owner on his mobile phone as a short message (SMS) at his request.

This project provides exposure to the fallowing technologies:
1. GSM modem.
2. GPS receiver.
3. Interfacing GSM modem and microcontroller.
4. LCD display.
5. Embedded C programming for microcontroller.
6. Design of PCB.
7. Hardware/Firmware design and development.

To run the code do the following steps:
1.> Download eclipse for embedded C and make project and copy paste the code to the project.
2.> Compile the code.
3.> Upload the code to microcontroller using AVR debugger.
